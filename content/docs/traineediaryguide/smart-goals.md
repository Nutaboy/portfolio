## What are SMART Goals
SMART goals are a framework for setting objectives that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This acronym helps ensure that goals are well-defined, realistic, and have a clear path to achievement. Here's a breakdown of each component:

**Specific:**

Clearly define the goal. Be specific about what you want to accomplish. Avoid vague language and provide details on what, why, and how.
Example: Instead of "Improve writing skills," specify "Write a minimum of 500 words every day to enhance business writing proficiency."

**Measurable:**

Establish criteria to track progress and determine when the goal is achieved. Quantify or use observable indicators to measure success.
Example: Instead of "Express in English in a business context," state "Practice business-related writing for 30 minutes daily and track the word count."

**Achievable:**

Ensure that the goal is realistic and attainable. Consider the resources, skills, and time available to achieve the goal.
Example: Instead of "Reflect myself," make it achievable with "Create a weekly self-reflection checklist covering key areas of personal and professional growth."

**Relevant:**

Align the goal with broader objectives and make sure it matters. The goal should be relevant to your overall personal or professional development.
Example: Instead of a generic goal, make it relevant with "Improve business writing skills to enhance communication in a professional context."

**Time-bound:**

Set a specific timeframe for achieving the goal. This adds urgency and helps prevent procrastination.
Example: Instead of an open-ended goal, set a timeframe with "Achieve a 10% increase in daily word count within the next month."

When you combine at least 4 of these elements, it will help you to have an more structured approach to your goals and how you verify them.
