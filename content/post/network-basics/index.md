## Overview

Welcome to the team I wish you a great start and time at our company ‚ù§Ô∏è
In this post I will guide you on the setup of your trainee diary. 
In a later post I will share with you a guide and my expectations.
If you have any questions or you are stuck at something just get in touch with me.
Looking forward to work with you and no worry if you don't really understand everything which will be going on in this tutorial.
If you want to copy or use something of my blog post feel free to do it though attribution is appreciated.‚úåüèø

## Goals


## Introduction

We and the things around as are connected with each other. In this module we will take a closer look on how this is achieved.
If w

There are different types of networks first of all we can classify it into local networks and 
- Small Home Networks
- Small Office and Home Office Networks  (SOHO)
- Medium to Large Networks
- World Wide Networks

Devices that are connected to a network:
- Smartphone
- Tablet
- Smartwatch
- Smart Glasses
- Security Systems
- Appliances (Washmachine etc.)
- Smart TV
- Gaming Console
- Smart Cars
- RFID tags
- Sensors and Actuators
- Medical Devices


Data is often used in IT in different topics but what do we understand if we talk about data in the network.
-Freiwillig
-unfreiwillig zahlungen
-observed data (geolocation to carrier when you used phone)

###¬†the bit
Did you know that computers and networks only work with binary digits, zeros and ones? It can be difficult to imagine that all of our data is stored and transmitted as a series of bits. Each bit can only have one of two possible values, 0 or 1. The term bit is an abbreviation of ‚Äúbinary digit‚Äù and represents the smallest piece of data. Humans interpret words and pictures, computers interpret only patterns of bits.

A bit is stored and transmitted as one of two possible discrete states. This can include two directions of magnetization, two distinct voltage or current levels, two distinct levels of light intensity, or any other physical system of two discrete states. For example, a light switch can be either On or Off; in binary representation, these states would correspond to 1 and 0 respectively.

Every input device (mouse, keyboard, voice-activated receiver) will translate human interaction into binary code for the CPU to process and store. Every output device (printer, speakers, monitors, etc.) will take binary data and translate it back into human recognizable form. Within the computer itself, all data is processed and stored as binary.

Computers use binary codes to represent and interpret letters, numbers and special characters with bits. A commonly used code is the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). With ASCII, each character is represented by eight bits. For example:

Capital letter: A = 01000001
Number: 9 = 00111001
Special character: # = 00100011
Each group of eight bits, such as the representations of letters and numbers, is known as a byte.

Codes can be used to represent almost any type of information digitally including computer data, graphics, photos, voice, video, and music.

In the figure, enter up to five characters in the Characters field, then click the Show Me button to see the ASCII bit translation. Click Reset to enter a different group of characters.

### Data Transmission

After the data is transformed into a series of bits, it must be converted into signals that can be sent across the network media to its destination. Media refers to the physical medium on which the signals are transmitted. Examples of media are copper wire, fiber-optic cable, and electromagnetic waves through the air. A signal consists of electrical or optical patterns that are transmitted from one connected device to another. These patterns represent the digital bits (i.e. the data) and travel across the media from source to destination as either a series of pulses of electricity, pulses of light, or radio waves. Signals may be converted many times before ultimately reaching the destination, as corresponding media changes between source and destination.

There are three common methods of signal transmission used in networks:

Electrical signals - Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.
Optical signals - Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses.
Wireless signals - Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.
Click Play in the figure to see an animation of the three types of signal transmissions.

In most homes and small businesses, network signals are transmitted across copper wires (cables) or Wi-Fi enabled wireless connections. Larger networks employ fiber-optic cables in order to reliably carry signals for longer distances.



### Bandwidth

Streaming a movie or playing a multiplayer game requires reliable, fast connections. To support these ‚Äúhigh bandwidth‚Äù applications, networks have to be capable of transmitting and receiving bits at a very high rate.

Different physical media support the transfer of bits at different speeds. The rate of data transfer is usually discussed in terms of bandwidth and throughput.

Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data. Digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is typically measured in the number of bits that (theoretically) can be sent across the media in a second. Common bandwidth measurements are as follows:

Thousands of bits per second (Kbps)
Millions of bits per second (Mbps)
Billions of bits per second (Gbps)
Physical media properties, current technologies, and the laws of physics all play a role in determining available bandwidth.

The table shows the commonly used units of measure for bandwidth.
